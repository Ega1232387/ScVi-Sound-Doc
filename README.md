# ScVi-Sound-Doc
a repo for working on documenting all sound names in ScVi's Stream.pck file, to be used as a custom label file in RingingBloom

Drag this into "RingingBloom\MHWorld\PCK" and open RingingBloom.
If you now import a pck file, it will load the names for the sound files whose WWise IDs are in this lbl file.

Do NOT upload this to GameBanana.
I will do so myself once it's finished.
